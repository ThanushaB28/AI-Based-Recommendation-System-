Task 4: AI-Based Recommendation System
In this task, I developed an AI-based Recommendation System in Java without relying on external files. The system applies an item-based collaborative filtering approach to suggest products based on user preferences.

A small sample dataset of users, items, and ratings is directly built into the program. The system computes cosine similarity between items and predicts ratings for items a user has not yet rated. Based on these predicted ratings, it generates the top-N recommendations for each user.

** Key Features:

Implemented in pure Java (no external files required).

Uses item-based collaborative filtering for recommendations.

Computes cosine similarity between items for prediction.

Provides top-N product recommendations for a chosen user.

Fully self-contained: just run the code to get output.
